Introduction

Hi there, thanks for stopping by! I'm CJ, a data analytics consultant, based on the east coast. I am passionate about the function of organizations, systems and society. My mission is to harness the power of data to meet needs. Daily, I work to work with data (spatial, observational, numerical) to solve problems. I strive to make complex data problems seem simple, and bring clarity to ambiguity. 

My vision is a world where data-driven insights are used to foster harmony and efficiency, transcending service level conflicts and addressing the root causes of (organizational, societal, relationsional) discord.

Before then, I worked at serveral other national and international organizations including Save the Children, Urban Alliance, and the United States Census Bureau in public facing operations and data management.
