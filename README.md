# Welcome

**<p align="center">Introduction** üëãüèæ 

<p align="center"> Welcome, and thank you for stopping by my "hub"! I'm affectionately known as CJ, and daily, I work to work with data (location data, website traffic data, demongraphic data, sales data, etc.) to solve problems. I am highly skilled at making complex problems (given the scale, resources available, and overall scope) feasible for organizations and communities to address. My efforts bring clarity to ambiguity, and foster the intentionality neccessary for organizations to actualize desired outcomes.

**Career** üíº

I have over 10 years of experience in public administration. Previosly, I worked at Achieving the Dream (ATD) for several years where I was promoted to Assistant Director of the Data, Technology and Analytics. Before that time, I worked in data management and administration at (inter)nationally recognized organizations such as Save the Children, Johns Hopkins University, Urban Alliance and the United States Census Bureau. 

I've worked on a bunch of different projects and teams, some of which I've highlighted below:

* US Department of Commerce's DMV Regional Equity and Growth Playbook: Sourced, processed and analyzed data to develop an interactive platform for users to explore findings of geospatial analysis
* ROOT Inc.'s Marketing Bidding Strategy Optimization: Built a random forest classification model to ensure that for every 10,000 ads shown to potential customers, at least 400 customers are acquired
* Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's Integrated Planning and Advising for Student Success (iPASS): Provided technical assistance for 10+ institutions of Higher Education with Early alert, Risk targeting systems, Progress roadmaps and tracking systems, Relationship management systems (CRM), Retention management, Communication tools, Student intake surveys, Data warehouses, Reporting and analytics, Predictive modeling, and Advisor and student dashboards
* State of Maryland‚Äôs Safe and Supportive Schools (MDS3) Initiative: Utilized ASSIST and Double Check research methods to evaluate and implement evidence-based instruction practices and bullying prevention in Maryland public schools
* US Census Bureau's Governments Division Historical Data Digitization Project: Carefully managed and produced data records in an online format for Census data users

**Education** üìö

In April of 2022, I completed a Data Science Fellowship with Correlation One, internationally recognized as one of the highest-rated data training programs in the world, achieving a certificate in Data Science with honors. In February of 2020, I obtained a Certificate in Systems Thinking from Cornell University in which I gained knowledge and expertise in examining and analyzing complex systems. I attended Temple Univerity, gaining Bachelor of Arts with distinction in Sociology and minor in Geography, where I established skills in Data Analysis (SPSS), Research Methods, Applied Statistics and Geospatial Analysis.

**Mission** üó∫Ô∏è

I'm driven by problem solving, and quite passionate about the function of organizations, systems and society. My mission is to harness the power of data to meet the needs of our growing world. My vision is a world where data-driven insights are used to foster harmony and efficiency, transcending surface level problems and thinking to instead address foundational sources of (organizational, societal, relationsional) discord.
