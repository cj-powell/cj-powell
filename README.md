**Introduction**

Welcome, and thank you for stopping by my "hub"! I'm affectionately known as CJ, and daily, I work to work with data (location data, traffic data, demongraphic data, sales data, etc.) to solve problems. I am highly skilled at making complex problems (given the scale, resources available, and overall scope) feasible for organizations and communities to address. My efforts bring clarity to ambiguity, and they foster the intentionality neccessary for organizations to not only strive to achive their missions, but actualize the desired outcomes that they are seeking.

**Background**

I have over 10 years of experience in public administration. Previosly, I worked at ATD for several years where I was promoted to Assistant Director of the Data, Technology and Analytics team. Before that time, I worked in administration and data management at nationally and internationally recognized organizations such as Save the Children, Urban Alliance, and the United States Census Bureau. 

I've worked on a bunch of different teams and projects, including:

US Department of Commerces' DMV Regional Equity and Growth Playbook:
ROOT Inc.'s Marketing Bidding Strategy Optimization: Built a random forest classification model to ensure that for every 10,000 ads shown, at least 400 customers are acquired
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations' Integrated Planning and Advising for Student Success (iPASS): Provided technical assistance for 10 institutions with Early alert, Risk targeting systems, Degree audits, Academic planning systems (including financial, career, and co-curricular planning ), Progress roadmaps and tracking systems, Schedule planning, Relationship management systems (CRM), Retention management, Communication tools, Student intake surveys, Data warehouses, Reporting and analytics, Predictive modeling, and Advisor and student dashboards
State of Marylandâ€™s Safe and Supportive Schools (MDS3) Initiative: 
US Census Buraueas' Governments Division Historical Data Digitization Project:

GrantCancer: Built decision tree model to predict the cost of cancer care for breast cancer patients
Fraud: Designed 5 fraud detection models that saved a government agency over 500 million dollars
Infectious Disease: Built an infectious disease lab testing dashboard in Tableau for a state with the population of 1 million residents.

**Education**

In April of 2022, I completed an internationally recognized Data Science Fellowship with Correlation One with Honors. Prior to that I obtained a Certificate in Systems Thinking from Cornell University. I gratuated with a Bachelor of Arts with distinction in Sociology (with a focus on SPSS) and a minor in Georgaphy (where I was first introduced to GIS).

**Mission**

I'm driven by problem solving, and quite passionate about the function of organizations, systems and society. My mission is to harness the power of data to meet the needs of our growing world. My vision is a world where data-driven insights are used to foster harmony and efficiency, transcending service level conflicts and addressing the sources of (organizational, societal, relationsional) disfunction.
