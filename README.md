# bio

Welcome, and thanks for stopping by! I'm CJ. I'm currently working as a Data Analytics Consultant, for a firm based in the Washington-Baltimore region. Daily, I work to work with data (spatial, observational, numerical) to solve problems. I strive to make complex data problems seem simple, and bring clarity to ambiguity. 

Background

I have over 10 years of experience in public administration. Previosly, I worked at ATD for several years on the Data, Technology and Analytics team. Before then, I worked at serveral other national and international organizations including Save the Children, Urban Alliance, and the United States Census Bureau in administration and data management. I additionally worked in marketing, university research.

I've worked on a bunch of different teams and projects, including:

US Department of Commerces DMV Regional Equity and Growth Playbook
Bill and Melinda Gates' Integrated Planning and Advising for Student Success (iPASS) GrantCancer: Built decision tree model to predict the cost of cancer care for breast cancer patients

US Census Buraueas Governments Division Historical Data Digitization Project Infectious Disease: Built an infectious disease lab testing dashboard in Tableau for a state with the population of 1 million residents.

Education

I completed a Data Science Fellowship with Honors in 2022. Prior to that I obtained a Certificate in Systems Thinking from Cornell University. For undergraduate, I gratuated from Temple University with dinstinction in Sociology, and minored in Geography where I got my foundation in analytics through SPSS and GIS.

Personal

I'm driven by problem solving, and quite passionate about the function of organizations, systems and society. My mission is to harness the power of data to meet the needs of our growing world. My vision is a world where data-driven insights are used to foster harmony and efficiency, transcending service level conflicts and addressing the root causes of (organizational, societal, relationsional) discord.

I enjoy exploring new places, desgin and TikTok.
